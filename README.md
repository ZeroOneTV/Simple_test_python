For run this files, you need first install some programs.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.x.x
- Any IDE you like. ([Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/pycharm/download/#section=windows) , etc)

You just follow the installation instructions default from this links. 
If you dont want install theses programs,you can also run these code on websites with online language compilers.

### Runing code

To run this codes, you just need open the IDE you installed (in my case, is VS code) and run.

*If you just run this codes with exec "somefile.py", you do what is asked and then the CMD is closed before you see the return. Because by default Python is a scripting language and is interpreted, not compiled.If want run in CMD, you need to add in last line code "input()" and Run.*
